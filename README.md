Hands on Project for IoT Lab event on 24th March - SENSORA.
In this project we have used :
   -> NodeMCU ESP8266 - To connect and receice data from the server.
   -> LDR sensor - To check light intensity of the current state in the room.
   -> Adafruit IO - Which is acting as a Server and is also used to create a dashboard using which the lights can also be controlled by the user/customer.
   -> LED lights or a relay which is connected to the actual light can be used as the Output source.
